Here is just one simple example of using qt5 widget as plugin in rqt. It publish and subcribe cmd_vel topic. The slider will publish the cmd_vel topic and the odometer needles will display subsribed cmd_vel.   

The example is based on ros2 Humble. So install that first, then rosdep install this package dependencies, colcon build and source the built package.
